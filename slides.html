# OpenStack Upgrades

---

## Who is this Lars guy anyway?

- Hi there.  I'm new here.
- Started in September 2013.
- Somebody gave me this hat.

## Overview

Three upgrade scenarios:

1. Upgrade everything at once

2. Upgrade one service at a time

3. Upgrade one service at time with a parallel Havana Nova
   environment.

---
 
## Scenario 1: Everything at once

- Simple because there's no orchestration involved
- Good for development or POC environments
- Not so good for real deployments because of extended downtime

---

## Scenario 1: Everything at once

- Generally looks like:

        openstack-service stop
        yum upgrade
        upgrade-all-the-databases
        openstack-service start

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- Instead of one major service interruption...
- ...lots of smaller ones.  Yay!
- Schedule Nova upgrade separately from other services

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- Generally looks like:

      openstack-service stop keystone
      yum upgrade *keystone*
      keystone-manage db_sync
      openstack-service start keystone

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- This is a great way to spot package dependency problems.

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Like scenario 2, except for Nova
- Deploy Havana Nova environment on new hardware
- Maximizes availability of compute service
- Requires additional hardware

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Migrate workloads through attrition, or
- Migrate workloads via snapshot-delete-boot
- Havana Nova can see snapshots created in Grizzly Nova
  (sharing Glance, Cinder, Neutron, Swift, etc)

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- New Nova environment is set up in Keystone as a new region.
  - New endpoint for compute
  - New endpoint for volume
- CLI tools are happy (with --os-region-name or `OS_REGION_NAME`)
- Horizon not so much

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

Migrating an instance looks like:

    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      image-create <instance> <instance>_migrate
    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      delete <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      boot --image <instance>_migrate ... <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      add-floating-ip <instance> <ipaddr>

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Reinstall Grizzly compute nodes as Havana compute nodes
  after all workloads are gone

Not tested:

- Volume service
- Nova networking

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- **What were they thinking?**
- Configuration files have all changed location
- Python modules have all changed names
- Configuration files *include* names of Python modules

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Neutron code doesn't know anything about old config files. So:

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- **What were they thinking?**
- Quantum database has no versioning information 
  until you explicitly put it there
- So nothing as simple as `neutron-manage db sync`.
- Starting Neutron before database upgrade can break database

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Checking database version:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini current

Setting database version:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini stamp grizzly

---

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Upgrading database:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini upgrade head

---

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- New `openstack-neutron` packages take much of the pain away
- Quantum client seems happy talking to Neutron server

---
 
## Upgrading Horizon

- `local_settings` substantially different between Grizzly and Havana
  packages
- Requires manual inspection

---

## CI Testing

- We have introduced one [Jenkins job][jenkins] running Dan's
  [test_rdo_upgrade][] script that validates all-in-one upgrades
- We want to get some piecewise upgrade testing in place

[test_rdo_upgrade]: https://github.com/kk7ds/test_rdo_upgrade
[jenkins]: http://jenkins.rhev.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com:8080/job/packstack-rdo-grizzly-havana-upgrade/

---

## CI Testing

- Neutron has poor coverage in existing automated test tools (e.g.,
  Tempest).
- No gating tests in upstream CI.
