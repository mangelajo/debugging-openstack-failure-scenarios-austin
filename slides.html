## Overview

Three upgrade scenarios:

1. Upgrade everything at once

2. Upgrade one service at a time

3. Upgrade one service at time with a parallel Havana Nova
   environment.

---
 
## Scenario 1: Everything at once

- Simple because there's no orchestration involved
- Good for development or POC environments
- Not so good for production deployments because of extended downtime

???

Nova upgrades are O(number of instances), and Dan tells me that e.g.
at Rackspace, a single database migration step can take 10-15 hours,
and there are several steps involved in getting from Grizzly to
Havana.

---

## Scenario 1: Everything at once

- Generally looks like:

        openstack-service stop
        yum upgrade
        upgrade-all-the-databases
        openstack-service start

<img src="all-the-things.png" width="200" />

???

This has to happen on all nodes in your OpenStack environment.

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- Instead of one major service interruption...
- ...lots of smaller ones.  Yay!
- Schedule Nova upgrade separately from other services

???

This may be a better choice for some organizations because it allows
them to decouple the upgrade of Nova from the upgrade of simple
services such as Keystone, Cinder, or Glance.

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- Generally looks like:

      openstack-service stop keystone
      yum upgrade *keystone*
      keystone-manage db_sync
      openstack-service start keystone

---

## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- This is a great way to spot package dependency problems.

???

It turns out that upgrading one component at a time is a great way to
flush out rpm dependency problems.  In many cases runtime requirements
were getting resolved by chance because another installed packages was
pulling in the requisite dependencies.

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Like scenario 2, except for Nova
- Deploy Havana Nova environment on new hardware
- Maximizes availability of compute service
- Requires additional hardware

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- New Nova environment is set up in Keystone as a new region.
  - New endpoint for compute
  - New endpoint for volume
- CLI tools are happy (with --os-region-name or `OS_REGION_NAME`)
- Horizon not so much

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Migrate workloads through attrition, or
- Migrate workloads via snapshot-delete-boot
- Havana Nova can see snapshots created in Grizzly Nova
  (sharing Glance, Cinder, Neutron, Swift, etc)

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

Migrating an instance looks like:

    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      image-create <instance> <instance>_migrate
    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      delete <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      boot --image <instance>_migrate ... <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      add-floating-ip <instance> <ipaddr>

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova

- Reinstall Grizzly compute nodes as Havana compute nodes
  after all workloads are gone

Not tested:

- Volume service
- Nova networking

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- **What were they thinking?**
- Configuration files have all changed location
- Python modules have all changed names
- Configuration files *include* names of Python modules

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Neutron code doesn't know anything about old config files. So:

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- **What were they thinking?**
- Quantum database has no versioning information 
  until you explicitly put it there
- So nothing as simple as `neutron-manage db sync`.
- Starting Neutron before database upgrade can break database

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Checking database version:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini current

Setting database version:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini stamp grizzly

---

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

Upgrading database:

    neutron-db-manage --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
      --config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini upgrade head

---

## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron

- New `openstack-neutron` packages take much of the pain away
- Quantum client seems happy talking to Neutron server

---
 
## Upgrading Horizon

- `local_settings` substantially different between Grizzly and Havana
  packages
- Requires manual inspection

---

## CI Testing

- We have introduced one [Jenkins job][jenkins] running Dan's
  [test_rdo_upgrade][] script that validates all-in-one upgrades
- We want to get some piecewise upgrade testing in place

[test_rdo_upgrade]: https://github.com/kk7ds/test_rdo_upgrade
[jenkins]: http://jenkins.rhev.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com:8080/job/packstack-rdo-grizzly-havana-upgrade/

---

## CI Testing

- Neutron has poor coverage in existing automated test tools (e.g.,
  Tempest).
- No gating tests in upstream CI.

## PPS

When you run Nova (NO!), Nova Havana  
Neutron will drive you bananas  
When you run Nova (NO!), Nova Havana  
Your OVS switches will have you in stitches  
When you run Nova...
